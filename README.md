I design websites that are quite simple and just work. Thatâ€™s always my motto. You should take a look at my website to see this in action - https://www.amithraravi.com!

I've been working on Frontend development primarily in the last 3 years. I've worked with node.js, React, static site generators like Jekyll/Gatsby, Docker/CircleCI for CI/CD, Grunt, Gulp, Babel and webpack. CSS, HTML5, JavaScript (with ES6) are the bedrock of my web design experience. In fact, the current version of my site is built using Jekyll.

I've also worked on web optimisation techniques - asset compression, image conversion, font delivery techniques, faster delivery using CDNs, SEO optimisations, Adherence to Web Content Accessibility Standards and debugging performance issues using WebPageTest.

Writing is my passion and I have been writing articles on Google+, photo stories on Instagram and more recently, longer articles on Medium (https://medium.com/@raravi) and on my personal blog (www.amithraravi.com).

Before working in Frontend design, Iâ€™ve worked in the IT industry for over 8 years in other roles. I started off as an analyst, working through the technical aspects of the issue, and as a Tech Lead gained understanding on the business side as well. I've worked in Incident Management roles where I handle the clients and help the teams deliver as per SLAs. I have extensive experience in client-facing roles and leverage it to ensure my clients' total satisfaction with the product delivered.
