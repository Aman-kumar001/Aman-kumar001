I design websites that are quite simple and just work. Take a look at my website - https://www.amithraravi.com!

I've been working on Frontend development primarily in the last 3 years. I work with **React**, **node.js**, static site generators (**Jekyll**/**Gatsby**), **Docker**/**CircleCI** for CI/CD, **Grunt**, **Gulp**, **Babel** and **webpack**. **CSS**, **HTML5**, **JavaScript (with ES6)** are the bedrock of my web design experience.

**Web optimisation** techniques I've implemented include - asset compression, image conversion, font delivery techniques, faster delivery using CDNs, SEO optimisations, Adherence to Web Content Accessibility Standards and debugging performance issues using WebPageTest.

**Writing** is my passion and I have been writing articles on Google+, photo stories on Instagram and more recently, longer articles on Medium (https://medium.com/@raravi) and on my personal blog (www.amithraravi.com).

Before working in **Frontend** design, Iâ€™ve worked in the IT industry for over 8 years in other roles. I started off as an IT analyst, working through the technical aspects of the issue, and as a Tech Lead gained understanding on the business side as well. I've worked in Incident Management roles where I handle the clients and help the teams deliver as per SLAs. I have extensive experience in client-facing roles and leverage it to ensure my clients' total satisfaction with the product delivered.
